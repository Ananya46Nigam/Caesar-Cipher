# Caesar-Cipher
A Cool Tool for easy encryption and decryption ! Your secret message remains safe and intact  ;-) 

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, for decoding ..with a left shift of 3, d would be replaced by a, e would become b, and so on. And vice versa for Encoding.
